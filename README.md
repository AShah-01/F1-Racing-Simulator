My project is a competitive, split-screen, Python racing game inspired by the high-octane world of Formula One racing. The game offers a thrilling top-down perspective, allowing two players to control their F1 cars using keyboards. The objective is clear yet challenging: be the first to complete five laps and claim the checkered flag. Nitro Boosts: As players navigate the track, they can collect nitro canisters. These canisters provide a temporary speed boost, allowing strategic use to overtake opponents and gain an edge. Maneuvering and Collisions: While clean racing is encouraged, the game allows skilled players to outmaneuver their rivals, adding a layer of strategy and competition. This game is designed for anyone who enjoys fast-paced racing games and friendly competition. The combination of speed, nitro boosts, strategic maneuvering, and the potential for bumping makes this game an exciting and unforgettable experience for both players. This statement of intent provides a solid foundation for the game's development. I plan to explore additional features such as additional power-ups or obstacles. By implementing these features, I aim to create an even more engaging and well-rounded game experience.


For this project you will need:
  - Most recent version of "python" and "pip"
  - pygame
  - os
  - math



After seeing my code you may come to understand that the Assets folder is missing, as I am new to Git Hub, I have just created a second branch where my assets are being held. Please let me know if anyone reads this and can help me improve at using this platform.


When running this code straight from a device make sure to create a folder called "Assets" and the ".py" file outside the assets folder


This code has entirely been written by me
